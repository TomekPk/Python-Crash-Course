3-9. Dinner Guests: Working with one of the programs from Exercises 3-4
through 3-7 (page 46), use len() to print a message indicating the number
of people you are inviting to dinner.

len(guest_list)

3-10. Every Function: Think of something you could store in a list. For example,
you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything
else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items
and then uses each function introduced in this chapter at least once.
